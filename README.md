# Description
This is a platform for analyzig texts. The idea is to manipulate texts, and analyze their phonology and morphology in a Text-Editor-like environment. This application is written in Python and it aims to be cross-platform. 
Currently, it is developed and tested on a MAC. It is still very early in development so it is very buggy!
